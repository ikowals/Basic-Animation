Pseudocode:
import pygame
import random

def main():
	pygame.init(), initiazing pygame modules for use in code
	screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640,480)), in order to set the boundaries of the pygame window that the user can see
	pygame.display.set_caption("UFO!"), which will be the title of the dsiplay window tab
	background = pygame.Surface(screen.get_size()), set the size of the pygame area equal to the screen boundaries
	background.convert the background, in order to be able to apply properties to it
	background.fill("blue")
	
	load the meteor image equal to a variable
	load sky image equal to a variable
	load ufo image equal to a variable
	convert alpha to ufo, sky, and meteor in order to load the associated images

	scale the ufo, sky, and meteor apprirately, with the sky taking up the who visible screen
	set meteor x position = 0
	set meteo y postion = 200
	set ufo x position = 100
	set ufo y position = 100

	clock = pygame.time.Clock(), in oder to be able to update the screen and move image postion
	keepGoing = True

	while keepGoing:
		clock.tick(30), setting the update time
		for event in pygame.event.get():
			if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
				keepGoing = False, stopping the game if you exit the game window
		add to meteor x a random int from 1 to 5
		add to meteor y a raondom int from 1 to 10
		add to ufo x a random int from -5 to 5
		add to ufo y a  random int from -10 to 10
		rotate the meteor 90 degrees each blit
		
		if meteor x is greater than the screen width:
			reset x position to 0
		if meteor y is greater tahn the screen width:
			reset y positon to 0
		if ufo y is greaeter than 400:
			subtract 10 from its postion
		if ufo x is greater than 600:
			subtract 5 from its positon
		if ufo x is less than 0:
			add 5 to its postion
		if ufo y is less than 0:
			add 10 to its positon
		screen.blit background at postion 0,0
		screen.blut sky at position 0,0
		screen.blit the ufo at its x and y position
		screen.blit the meteor at its x and y position

		pygame.display.flip() in order to display it in the best way for the user
